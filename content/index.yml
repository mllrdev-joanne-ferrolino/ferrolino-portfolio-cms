        I’ve had the pleasure of working with Sean for four years. During that time, he’s been my go-to person whenever I have questions about frontend development. While I’ve been more focused on backend work, I’ve always admired how proficient Sean is with frontend technologies and how he consistently stays up to date with the latest tools and best practices.

        Sean is easy to work with, approachable, and always willing to help. He explains things clearly and patiently, making collaboration smooth and productive. He brings both technical skill and a great attitude to the team, which makes him a valuable teammate and a great person to work with.

        I highly recommend Sean to any team looking for a skilled frontend developer who’s not only technically strong but also genuinely collaborative and supportive.

  description: Answers to common questions about how I work, collaborate, and what I’m looking for next.
  categories:
    - title: Work & Collaboration
      questions:
        - label: What kinds of projects do you focus on?
          content: |
            I build full‑stack web applications, dashboards, and SaaS platforms with data‑rich, user‑friendly interfaces. On the frontend I primarily use Vue/Nuxt (and React when needed). On the backend I work with Node.js and FastAPI, with PostgreSQL/Supabase for data, and modern serverless/cloud platforms like Vercel and Cloudflare.
        - label: How do you ensure scalability and code quality?
          content: |
            I favor type‑safe code (TypeScript), clear architecture and modular components, automated testing where it matters, and performance profiling. I document decisions, use code reviews, and set up CI to keep quality high as the product grows.
        - label: Do you work on greenfield or existing codebases?
          content: |
            Both. I enjoy greenfield builds and I’m experienced in migrations and modernization—e.g., leading an AngularJS → Angular upgrade using Web Components while reducing technical debt.
    - title: Compensation & Availability
      questions:
        - label: How do you approach compensation discussions?
          content: |
            Compensation depends on the role’s scope, responsibilities, and overall package. I prefer to align on impact and expectations first, then discuss a market‑competitive offer accordingly. I’m also comfortable aligning with established salary bands and total compensation frameworks.
        - label: Are you open to contract or freelance work?
          content: |
            Yes—I'm open to full‑time roles as well as contract engagements. For contracts, I prefer clearly defined scopes, deliverables, and timelines.
        - label: What is your availability and timezone compatibility?
          content: |
            I primarily work in UTC+8 and can align to overlapping hours for teams in other timezones. I’m comfortable with remote and hybrid collaboration, async workflows, and scheduled syncs for key milestones.
        - label: What roles are you looking for?
          content: |
            Primarily **Full‑stack Software Engineer** or **Frontend Engineer (Vue/Nuxt)** roles. I’m comfortable working with React when needed and I’m open to senior IC positions, hands‑on tech leadership, and platform‑focused full‑stack work.
        - label: What’s your notice period?
          content: |
            Typically **1–3 weeks**, depending on active workload and handover requirements. I’ll align timelines to ensure a smooth transition.

            - Driving and exploring new places
            - Cross‑fit training
        - label: What motivates your work as an engineer?
          content: |
            Turning complex ideas into scalable, well‑designed products that feel effortless to use. I love shaping systems where design consistency, performance, and developer experience work together.
        - label: What tech do you prefer working with?
          content: |
            Vue 3, Nuxt, Node.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL/Supabase, and modern tooling (Vite, GitHub, CI/CD). I’m pragmatic and will choose the right tool for the job.
