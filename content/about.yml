  Hi, I'm **Sean Erick Ramones**, a full‑stack software engineer with over 7 years of experience building modern, performant web applications.

  I focus on turning complex ideas into elegant, scalable products where design consistency, performance, and developer experience all click. On the frontend I prefer **Vue 3** and **Nuxt**; on the backend **Node.js** and **FastAPI**; for data, **PostgreSQL/Supabase**; and I deploy to modern serverless/cloud platforms like **Vercel** and **Cloudflare**.

  ### What I care about

  - Type‑safe code and clean architecture
  - Reusable components and design systems
  - Performance, accessibility, and DX
  - CI/CD and code review culture that scales

  ### Selected experience

  - Miller Development AB — Full‑stack Software Engineer (2019–Present)
  - SCI Global Services — Full‑stack Software Developer (2018–2019)
  - Better Trade Off Ltd. — Software Developer (Contract, 2023–2024)

  ### Beyond the keyboard

  - Running and cross‑fit training
  - Watching anime; reading Japanese manga/light novels
  - Playing MOBA games (**Dota 2**) and relaxing games (**Stardew Valley**)
  - Driving and exploring new places
