# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Principle I - Content-First Architecture**:
- [ ] All page content managed via YAML/Markdown in `content/` directory
- [ ] Zod schemas defined in `content.config.ts` for new content types
- [ ] No hardcoded content in components (structural elements only)

**Principle II - Type-Safe Schema Validation**:
- [ ] Content collections have corresponding Zod schemas
- [ ] Auto-generated types from `@nuxt/content` are leveraged
- [ ] Schema changes include migration plan

**Principle III - Nuxt UI Component System**:
- [ ] Components use Nuxt UI library over custom implementations
- [ ] Tailwind utilities used over custom CSS
- [ ] Custom components follow PascalCase naming and expose variant APIs

**Principle IV - Composition API Patterns**:
- [ ] Components use Composition API with `<script setup>`
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for all props
- [ ] Specific types imported from `@nuxt/content`

**Principle V - pnpm Workflow Standards**:
- [ ] Package management uses `pnpm` exclusively
- [ ] ESLint standards followed (comma-dangle: never, braceStyle: 1tbs)
- [ ] Commands executed through pnpm scripts in package.json

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
